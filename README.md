pong game using c++ and raylib library

Requires usage of maker file:

This was made for one person to play against themselves. So the controles are as folows: 

Left side bar up key: e
Left side bar down key: d

Right side bar up key: Up arrow
Right side bar down key: Down arrow

Note: this ball increases with speed after each collision. Game ends if the ball reaches the boundary of the screen- so don't let!
